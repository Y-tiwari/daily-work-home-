        <h1>Paragraph tag:-</h1>
        <p style="width: bold; color: brown;">The environment is dependent on the interaction between all the different components. However, human beings play a huge role in the making and breaking of the environment. Being the supreme most intellectual power on Earth, human beings influence the wellness of the environment to a great extent. The impact of the environment on all living beings is directly proportional to the way human beings treat the environment. Any kind of existence would not be possible without air, water or land. Nothing to eat, not a drop to drink and nowhere to go is not what we or our future generations should expect to have. Every living thing depends largely on the environment for survival, and having a clean and safe environment is solely in the hands of the human beings.</p>
